\section{Preliminaries}

Thorughout this thesis, we will mention neural networks and many other machine learning terminology that the reader might be unfamiliar with. So in this section, we will give an overview of what neural networks are and how they are constructed. If the reader already has basic knowledge of what NN are and how they are learend, this section can be safely skipped.

In general, we give the neural network a $d$-dimensional vector $\bm{x}$ (we denote vectors with variables in bold) as input and as output we obtain either a single number or another vector. The output is the \textit{prediction} of the neural network given the input $\bm{x}$. A few examples of predicted quantities given some input could be the price of a house given various information about it (e.g., age, size, location, etc.), the probability of a dark skin area being a melanoma given a picture of it or a Japanese translation given a German sentence. A neural network arrives at the prediction by \textit{transforming} the input. Concretely, matrix operations are being performed. As a simple example, consider input $\bm{x} \in \mathds{R}^{4 \times 1}$ and \enquote{weights} $\bm{w} \in \mathds{R}^{4 \times 1}$. The operation $\bm{w}^\top \cdot \bm{x} = \hat{y}$ yields a single number, the predicted quantity. The symbol $\cdot$ denotes the matrix product and the symbol $\hat{}$ denotes any variable below it is a prediction. Writing it out:

\begin{align} \label{eq:first_network}
    x_0 w_0 + x_1 w_1 + x_2 w_2 + x_3 w _3 = \hat{y}.
\end{align} If the weights have more than one column, e.g., if $\bm{W} \in \mathds{R}^{4 \times 3}$, then the operation $\bm{W}^\top \cdot \bm{x} = \hat{\bm{y}}$ yields a three-dimensional vector:

\begin{align} \label{eq:second_network}
    \begin{split}
        x_0 w_{00} + x_1 w_{10} + x_2 w_{20} + x_3 + w_{30} & = \hat{y}_0, \\
        x_0 w_{01} + x_1 w_{11} + x_2 w_{21} + x_3 + w_{31} & = \hat{y}_1, \\
        x_0 w_{02} + x_1 w_{12} + x_2 w_{22} + x_3 + w_{32} & = \hat{y}_2.
    \end{split}
\end{align}We can visualize the aforementioned matrix calculations using nodes and arrows, visible in Figure~\ref{fig:first_second_network}. The nodes represent individual entries of the respective vectors and the arrows multiplication with the weights. In Figure~\ref{fig:second_network}, we omitted writing the weights on the arrows for better visibility.

\noindent The calculations performed in Equation~\ref{eq:first_network} and Equation~\ref{eq:second_network} deliver a predicted quantity, however hardly any scholar would call them neural networks. Looking at following equation, we can be confident in stating it is a neural network:

\begin{align} \label{eq:third_network}
    \bm{W}^{[3]\top} \cdot \underbrace{h \big( \bm{W}^{[2]\top} \cdot \underbrace{h \big( \bm{W}^{[1]\top} \cdot \bm{x} \big)}_{\bm{a}^{[1]}} \big)}_{\bm{a}^{[2]}} = \hat{y},
\end{align}where $\bm{x} \in \mathds{R}^{4 \times 1}$, $\bm{W}^{[1]} \in \mathds{R}^{4 \times 5}$, $\bm{W}^{[2]} \in \mathds{R}^{5 \times 3}$, $\bm{W}^{[3]} \in \mathds{R}^{3 \times 1}$ and $h$ is an element-wise non-linear function. The intermediate results $\bm{a}^{[1]}$ and $\bm{a}^{[2]}$ are commonly called \enquote{activations}. Numbers in brackets are used to differentiate between variables and otherwise have no effect mathematically. Visualizing Equation~\ref{eq:third_network}, we obtain a graph structure as in Figure~\ref{fig:third_network}. We can see that the activations (i.e., intermediate results) are also represented using nodes. An array of nodes forming one activation vector we refer to as \enquote{hidden layer}.

\noindent When we refer to the \enquote{architecture} of a neural network, we mean the number of weight matrices, shape of weight matrices (i.e., how many rows and columns they have), types of activation functions and so on. The neural network depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:third_network} is small and simple, but enough for the sake of explaining. A good overview of different neural architectures can be found in \cite{bib:leijnen2020neural}. In case the reader wants to refresh their knowledge about neural networks, \cite{bib:goodfellow2016deep} provides a good resource.

Unless an algorithm is utilized that automatically searches for a neural architecture \cite{bib:elsken2019neural}, a neural architecture has to be chosen by humans. Apart from meaningful initialization \cite{bib:DLNN1}, what humans never choose are the \enquote{parameters} of the neural network (i.e., the individual values of the weight matrices), but obtain them using an algorithm. The idea of this algorithm is to build experience from a labeled dataset. As an analogy, imagine a grown-up human has never seen an animal before in their entire life. Then we give that person 100 Polaroids depicting cats with the word \enquote{cat} written on the white part under the picture. In machine learning terminology, we would call the picture a \enquote{training example} and the word \enquote{cat} written under it on the Polaroid a \enquote{label}. In the same fashion, we give 100 Polaroids depicting dogs to that person. The entirety of cat and dog Polaroids is the labeled dataset (unlabeled datasets are used in \textit{unsupervised machine learning} \cite{bib:ghahramani2003unsupervised}). If we then show that person a yet unseen picture of either a cat or dog, then they will surely be able to tell which animal it is, meaning the person has \textit{learned} to differentiate between cats and dogs. We can do the same with a neural network. We show it a certain number of $d$-dimensional vectors with entries ranging from 0-255 (images) and every image has a label to it, 0 for cat and 1 for dog. Given enough data, through a learning algorithm the network gets proper values in its weights, such that cat pictures fed to it should produce output 0 and dog pictures output 1. Showing the dataset to the network and adjusting the weights accordingly we call \enquote{learning} or \enquote{fitting}. If we feed a yet unseen picture to the network, it should hopefully still work the same. If the network performs badly on yet unseen pictures because its architecture is too simple, we call it \enquote{underfitting}. Conversely, if it performs badly because it is complex enough to only remember pecularities in the dataset and does not grasp the general concept, we call it \enquote{overfitting}.

In order to learn the parameters of a neural network, gradient descent with backpropagation \cite{bib:linnainmaa1976taylor} at its core is almost exclusively used nowadays. Backpropagation provides the gradients of the weights with respect to some \textit{loss function}. A loss function compares the prediction of the network and returns a high value if the prediction is bad and a low value if the prediction is good. We want to minimize the loss, thus the gradients of it with respect to the neural network weights provide us the direction where we want to go. We update the weights by subtracting the current gradients, scaled by a parameter called \enquote{learning rate}, from it. This procedure is called \enquote{gradient descent} and can be used with many different loss functions for many different problems which includes models that are not neural networks. Nowadays gradient descent is refined by adding many heuristics to it, for example choosing the optimal step size per parameter, the concept of \enquote{momentum}, \enquote{batching} and many more. An explanation of the terms mentioned in this paragraph and an overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms can be found in \cite{bib:ruder2016overview}.
